## What this is

A simple BP neural network which has a Input layer, hidden layer and output layer.

## What has been completed

The main construction and some calculation rules.

Plus fd_max.cpp telling you how to train a network which can choose the larger from two values.

## Future improvements:

Use class to wrap the three kinds of layers, and finally put them in one class.

Plus think about how to choose reasonable training parameters.

Maybe also experiment with training with *more than* one HiddenLayers?
